## Getting started
First of all, you need to install uBlock Origin (The best Adblocker):

[Opera extension](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/ublock), [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin), [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm), [uBlock's github](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)

Most of the adblockers, are compatible with this filter! (for example, ublock, adguard, adp)
